# ExtractPoshFromExe
Extracts the original PowerShell scripts from a PowerGUI script executable

The extracted scripts will be saved in the same folder as the original executable and will be name Scripts.zip.
If the executable was protected with a password then the zip password is the same.

* only works on executables generated with PowerGUI (Script Editor) *

I should really make it a nice function with parameters and perhaps include unzip functionality but this is it for now...
